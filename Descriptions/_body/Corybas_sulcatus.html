          <div><p><b>Plant:</b> leaves orbicular, 12-20 x 12-20 mm, light green with visible veins above, silvery green beneath, apiculate.</p>
	<p><b>Flowers:</b> arising Â± halfway along the petiole below the leaf lamina but sitting above. Most parts dark red, 25-30 mm long, 10-14 mm wide. Dorsal sepal hooded over most of the labellum, dark red mottled green, lighter and striate towards the base. Lateral sepals erect to spreading, 30 mm long. Petals erect to spreading, 10-15mm long. Labellum midlobe cream to pale yellow in the centre, margins incurved, irregular to toothed, with a deep central groove.</p>
	<p><b>Flowering:</b> October to November.</p>
	<p><b>Habitat:</b> shrublands. Campbell Island, Chatham Islands and isolated locations in the lower North and South Islands. 
	<p><b>Conservation:</b> Sparse. Data deficient.</p>
	<p><b>Notes:</b> first described from Macquarie Is. Forms there seem much greener. Some in NZ are <a href = "Corybas_tussock.html">very dark</a>.  Probably more widespread in South Island alpine areas which are poorly explored.</p>
	<p><b>Key features:</b> easily recognized by its ball shaped flower and mottled maroon dorsal sepal and outer labellum.</p>
